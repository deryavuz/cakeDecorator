# cakeDecorator

# Our initial developments & Milestone 1!
We have built our syringe structure with a vertical gear involved, which will serve to push the frosting down towards the hole on the bottom of the syringe to decorate the cake. The syringe is not stable as of now but we will stabilize it using the new CAD's that we will make and also will work in RPL.

A stepper motor is attached to the arc of the vertical gear, to automate the turning motion. 

# Milestone 2 & recent developments!
